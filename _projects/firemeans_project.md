This is a project in honor of my great-grandmother. 

In the beliefs of the villagers of Huangl√ºe, afterlife exists. The project stretches this concept and discusses the communicative property of fire and visualizes a space where audiences are enabled to express their valuable feelings to their loved ones.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

<!-- You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images. -->
